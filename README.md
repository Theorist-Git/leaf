# Leaf
* A stack based programming language from scratch.
* Inspired by [PORTH](https://github.com/tsoding/porth)

## Build:
  
* Simulation:
  ```bash
  $ ./leaf.py sim
  ```
  
* Compilation:
  ```bash
  $ ./leaf.py com
  ```
  
// Currently dump function cannot handle negative values.
// dump.c is compiled to intel asm and is used in compile() function.

### --TODO-- :
Reduce Hard-coding of data and programs
